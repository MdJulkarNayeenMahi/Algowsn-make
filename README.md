Sorting Fast Data on Sequential Sensors:

This is a raspberry- Arduino based LM35 (temperature) sequential sensor distributed Platform. This IoT platform works for Image Parsing as data packets/ frames through providing bits onto sensor network mediums. This is a sensor node based image / video processing scheme on wireless sensor network  to IoT infrastructure.
